### Secutiry Inspection System for Terrorist Images

We conducted research on the security detection of violent and terrorist images on the internet, and developed a deep learning-based security review system for such images. Our system employs algorithms and solutions from four different perspectives, including **deep learning model detection**, **analysis of image text content**, **recognition of the faces of leaders of violent and terrorist groups**, and **detection of specific targets associated with violent and terrorist activities**. Finally, we adopted a multi-solution joint mechanism to improve the limitations and detection rate of existing solutions.
